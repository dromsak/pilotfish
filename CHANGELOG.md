# Changelog

All notable changes to pilotfish. From v2.0.0 the installed version is the plugin's manifest version (`/plugin`); v1.x installs stamped it inside the policy block in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (`<!-- pilotfish vX.Y.Z -->`).

## v2.1.0 — 2026-07-13

**Haiku is out; the execution tier is Sonnet.** `scout` moves Haiku → Sonnet (`effort: low`) and `executor` moves Opus/medium → Sonnet/high. `verifier` stays on Opus and goes to `effort: high`. `mech-executor` (Sonnet/low) and `security-executor` (Opus/high) are unchanged. This makes the shipped configuration exactly the one Anthropic benchmarked: a frontier orchestrator with Sonnet 5 workers, at 96% of all-frontier performance for 46% of the cost.

Three reasons, in order of weight:

- **Scout output is unverified input to everything downstream.** The `verifier` gate covers executor work, not reconnaissance — so a wrong `file:line` from a scout becomes an executor confidently editing the wrong thing, and nothing catches it. Haiku 4.5 → Sonnet 5 is a large enough capability gap that this stops being theoretical. Recon is the one place cheapness compounds into error.
- **On subscriptions, Haiku was never the cheap option it looked like.** The weekly limit is two buckets — a shared all-models bucket plus an *additional* Sonnet-only bucket. Haiku draws on the scarce shared one; Sonnet can draw on dedicated headroom the frontier model cannot touch. For the subscriber this plugin is aimed at, moving recon to Sonnet can cost *less* of the resource that actually runs out, while being materially better.
- **Opus on `executor` was over-insurance.** Quality on cheap executors is bought back by the `verifier` — an independent fresh-context pass — more cheaply and more reliably than by upgrading the executor itself. Paying Opus rates for routine implementation *and* running a verifier was paying twice for the same guarantee. The verifier's effort bump to `high` is where that money goes instead; it is the role that makes the rest of the tier safe.

The three Sonnet roles are deliberately kept as three files. The `Agent` tool has no `effort` parameter — effort is settable only in agent frontmatter — so one role definition means one effort level, and collapsing them would run bulk mechanical work at `effort: high` for nothing.

Nothing about the guard's behaviour changes; only the text of its `Explore` denial, which names the tier `scout` is pinned to.

## v2.0.0 — 2026-07-13

**pilotfish is now a plugin.** Install with `/plugin marketplace add Nanako0129/pilotfish` and `/plugin install pilotfish@pilotfish`; invoke with `/pilotfish`. Nothing is merged into `~/.claude/` any more, nothing is written into your projects, and uninstalling removes every trace. The old hand-merged global install (`templates/`, `install/AGENT-INSTALL.md`, the `VERSION`/README/policy stamp coupling) is gone with it.

**The rules are now enforced, not requested.** A `PreToolUse` hook denies what the policy could previously only ask for: subagents may not detach a process (`nohup`, `setsid`, trailing `&`, `run_in_background`), and the built-in `Explore` agent is blocked in favour of `scout`. The main session keeps every capability — its backgrounding is the mechanism that works.

**The detach-and-yield pattern was the bug, and it is gone.** v1.1.1 told executors to launch long commands with `nohup` and end their turn; v1.1.3 added an orchestrator rule to arm a background wait on the yielded PID. That protocol spans two agents and fails on the first forgotten step. The underlying harness behaviour, established by experiment:

- A foreground command exceeding its `timeout` is not killed — it is promoted to a background task, with the message "you will be notified when it completes."
- In an agent spawned with `run_in_background: true`, that promise is kept: the promoted process survives the turn boundary *and* the agent returning, runs to completion, has its output captured, and its notification re-invokes the agent. Observed surviving 59s, 69s, 81s past a turn boundary and 141s past agent termination, with zero signals.
- In an agent spawned in the **foreground**, the promoted process is `SIGTERM`ed seconds after the agent returns. The work is destroyed and the captured output truncated mid-stream.

`nohup`/`setsid` dodge that `SIGTERM` by escaping the process group — but they also escape Claude Code's task tracking, so there is no task id, no captured output, and no notification. Detaching converts a destroyed result into an orphaned one. So subagents no longer detach at all: they run in the foreground with an explicit `timeout` and hand back anything that cannot finish inside one. **Long-running processes belong to the orchestrator** — the only context whose background tasks are both tracked and reliably notified. This also makes spawning agents with `run_in_background: true` load-bearing for correctness, not merely cost.

**`Explore` is blocked rather than shadowed.** Plugin agents are namespaced, so a plugin cannot override the built-in `Explore` — which since v2.1.198 inherits the main-session model and bills every background search at frontier rates. The guard blocks it and routes recon to `scout` (Haiku). Five roles now, not six.

## v1.1.5 — 2026-07-13

Fix named-role model routing at the Agent invocation boundary. The orchestration policy now requires calls to every existing named role to omit `model`, leaving the role file's frontmatter as the sole model source. This prevents an invocation alias from silently overriding the intended Haiku, Sonnet, or Opus assignment. Only truly ad-hoc agents with no named role definition may set an explicit invocation model.

This release also recommends a pinned local checkout for one-prompt installation and updates. The reviewed runbook and templates are read from the same release checkout, avoiding mutable cross-fetches and preserving Claude Code's WebFetch prompt-injection protection instead of asking users to bypass it.

New dependency-free policy tests lock the version stamp, named-role model ownership contract, ad-hoc exception, role frontmatter, and pinned README install commands together.

## v1.1.4 — 2026-07-13

Fix foreground-only delegation caused by an underspecified parallel-agent policy. The orchestrator now schedules by immediate data dependency: independent work and every independent fan-out call use `run_in_background: true`, while foreground execution is reserved for a result required by the very next main-session action when no other useful work can proceed. Background results still must be collected before dependent work or the final answer.

## v1.1.3 — 2026-07-12

Community-driven patch. Re-run the install prompt to upgrade.

| Change | Credit |
|---|---|
| **The orchestration policy now covers running agents in parallel** — three rules earned in a real four-executor fan-out (long-form rationale in [#7](https://github.com/Nanako0129/pilotfish/pull/7)): every writing agent in a parallel batch gets its own worktree, and the orchestrator harvests each worktree's changes on completion; a yielded agent (detached launch, PID + log path) is a handoff the orchestrator must monitor and resume, not a result; agent liveness is probed with a message, never diagnosed from host signals (no local CPU + a stale transcript is not a stuck agent). | [@dromsak](https://github.com/dromsak) (#7) |

The liveness rule's probe semantics were verified empirically before merging (a busy agent queues the probe; a completed one is resumed by it), which caught that the exact response strings vary across harness versions — the shipped rule describes the behavior instead of quoting strings.

## v1.1.2 — 2026-07-10

Hardening patch. Re-run the install prompt to upgrade.

| Change | Credit |
|---|---|
| **The six roles are now hard leaf agents.** The four executor roles get `disallowedTools: Agent, Workflow`; `verifier` extends its existing read-only exclusions with the same; `scout`/`Explore` were already leaves via their `tools` allowlist. Each also carries an explicit "you are a leaf agent" line so a genuinely mis-routed task is reported back instead of re-delegated. | [@dromsak](https://github.com/dromsak) (#6) |

This replaces v1.1.1's prompt-only guard with capability removal. The prompt guard put the routing table into every subagent's context, so a `mech-executor` could pattern-match its own task and re-delegate — observed cascading four levels deep in a real incident. Verified before merge: with the prompt guard a nested role still spawned (a haiku scout ran real work); with `disallowedTools` the spawn is blocked and the role does the work itself.

## v1.1.1 — 2026-07-10

Community-driven patch. Re-run the install prompt to upgrade.

| Change | Credit |
|---|---|
| Policy block now forbids subagent roles from spawning further subagents — delegation is a main-session-only concern. The recursive-spawn risk was verified empirically (a sonnet role successfully dispatched a haiku role) before merging | [@nicofirst1](https://github.com/nicofirst1) (#3, #5) |
| `executor` / `mech-executor` no longer babysit long-running processes: launch detached (nohup + log), one sanity check, then yield with PID + log path for the orchestrator to monitor | [@nicofirst1](https://github.com/nicofirst1) (#2, #4) |
| Follow-up to the above: a detached launch must be reported as a handoff, not a completed verification, when done-criteria depend on the process outcome | maintainer |
| Installer Step 4 verification updated for Claude Code 2.1.198+ (the `/agents` wizard was removed); verify via `/model` and by asking Claude which subagent types are available | [@zxcj04](https://github.com/zxcj04) (#1) |

## v1.1.0 — 2026-07-09

Security, accuracy, and update-flow release. Re-running the install prompt upgrades in place.

### Security & trust

| Change | Why |
|---|---|
| New **Trust & security** README section, with a tag/SHA-pinned install variant | `main` can change between review and install (TOCTOU); pinning makes what-you-reviewed = what-installs |
| Runbook: templates must be fetched from the same pinned ref as the runbook | Pinning now covers the actual installed bytes, not just the instructions |
| `scout` / `Explore` switched from a `disallowedTools` denylist to a positive `tools: Read, Glob, Grep` allowlist | They previously retained Bash, so "read-only" was prompted, not enforced |
| Runbook detects agent collisions by frontmatter `name:` (not filename) and flags plugin shadowing | Claude Code loads only one definition per name; `executor`/`scout` are common names |

### Behavior & quality

| Change | Why |
|---|---|
| Policy block self-disables for subagent roles | A custom `Explore` loads user memory (the built-in skips it); the policy is main-session-only |
| New policy rule: scout findings are unverified inputs | The verifier gate covers executor output, not reconnaissance |
| `verifier` runs maximum-thoroughness on security-sensitive work | medium-effort verification of high-effort security work was inconsistent |
| Versioning + "Updating an existing install" flow (this release) | Early installs had no way to learn about updates |

### Docs & claim accuracy

| Change | Why |
|---|---|
| Split Anthropic's endorsement (delegation + fresh-context verification) from pilotfish's own cheap-model routing thesis | Attribution honesty |
| 12-worker numbers reframed as an upper-bound, API-dollar experiment, with inline sources | One community experiment ≠ a guarantee; subscription quota ≠ API dollars |
| Explore warning corrected: inherited model is Opus-capped on the Claude API | Precision |
| `best`-alias fallback at the 7/12 boundary restated honestly (documented rule + June outage precedent; boundary UX unpublished; `fallbackModel` never triggers on billing errors) | The boundary hasn't been observed by anyone yet |
| Windows portability note; subscription-vs-API/Bedrock scope note; FAQ rows for spawn overhead, fast off-switch, managed environments, project-CLAUDE.md stacking | Compatibility coverage |

## v1.0.0 — 2026-07-08

Initial public release: three-layer global architecture (settings `best` + `fallbackModel`, six role agents with tiered model/effort bindings, role-based delegation policy), one-prompt agent-guided installer with approval gate and idempotent upgrades, bilingual README, sourced research report and design rationale.
